To test locally:
    #Install eksctl
	curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
	chmod +x ./eksctl 

    #Install kubectl
	curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
	chmod +x ./kubectl

Use EKS on AWS
